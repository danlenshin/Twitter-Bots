From far and near we came to Rutgers
And resolved to learn all that we can
And so we settled down
in that noisy college town
On the banks of the old Raritan
On the banks of the old Raritan, my friends
where old Rutgers ever more shall stand
For has she not stood
since the time of the flood
On the banks of the old Raritan
Then sing aloud to Alma Mater
And keep the scarlet in the van
For with her motto high
Rutgers' name shall never die
On the banks of the old Raritan
